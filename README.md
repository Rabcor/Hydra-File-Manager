Hydra File Manager

Version: **Proof of Concept**

My HUT based file manager will at version 1.0 have all the capabilities of Windows explorer that I can code on Linux (practically all of it). It will look and feel a lot like the explorer of Windows 7 with themeing support to look like Windows 10's explorer. It will be relatively lightweight and blazing fast. And it will have a sane file sorting mechanism. Support folder types, and hiding folders without prefixing them with a dot.

Later versions will include a Hydra theme that will probably look dramatically different, and may add more features.
